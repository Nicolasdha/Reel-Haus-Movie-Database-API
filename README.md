### Structure

This application's structure is responsive, and intuitive to use.

The page is automatically loaded with 20 random movie titles. In the top right-hand corner of the screen there is a search bar where you are able to search through millions of movies and TV shows.
Most will have a rating derived, and averaged through all of the user provided critisism. The ratings can be quite harsh at times (or maybe I just like bad movies). Once you have found a movie
that you are interested in simply hover over the movie, and text will appear with it's details including:

* A synopis of the movie
* The date of release
* The genres that it falls into


Once you have searched for something, or if you are just interested in browsing a random movies simply click the logo on the upper-left part of the screen. This is a simple page refresh, so please
feel free to do that as well.<br>

** *WARNING* **
>  ** This database is incredibly vast -- I have gone down the rabbit-hole looking up my favorite movies only to realize there was different installments I never knew about.


Thank you for visiting! <br><br><br>
